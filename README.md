# MLD_StudyGroup

## Purpose
The MLD study group aims to learn Python and Bayesian statistics (possibly other topics too) by studying together. 
We follow some great learining materials out there and help each other learn the meterials.

## Learing materials
Here's a list of learning materials.

### Python
- [Crash Course on Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course)
- [Introduction to Git and Github](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github?specialization=google-it-automation)

### Kinematics
- [EnvisionBOX](https://envisionbox.org/index.html)
- [Machine Learning Basics](https://github.com/EsamGhaleb/MachineLearningBasics)

### Bayesian statistics
- [Workshop on Bayesian Inference](https://4ccoxau.github.io/PriorsWorkshop/)
- [Statistical Rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2023)
- [An Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis for Cognitive Science](https://vasishth.github.io/bayescogsci/book/)
  - You can enroll an [complementary course](https://open.hpi.de/courses/bayesian-statistics2023) for free that covers the first 5 chapters.
